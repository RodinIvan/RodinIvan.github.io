Today, I was supposed to be in Seattle, gearing up for the first day of hashtag#CVPR2024. Unfortunately, my U.S. visa was rejected and subjected to "administrative processing", that could extend up to a year and a half. It seems that being a researcher in computer vision with Russian passport, despite residing in the EU for the past five years, raises some red flags...

Good news is that all my co-authors are attending CVPR in person. They are eager to discuss our work on Egocentric Action Scene Graphs (https://lnkd.in/dsJxqSuf), so please don't hesitate to reach out to them for insights into our research.

Good news (x2), this July, I’ll be attending hashtag#ICVSS in Sicily! I’m looking forward to enjoying a week with fellow computer vision enthusiasts. If you’re also heading to ICVSS, drop me a message!
